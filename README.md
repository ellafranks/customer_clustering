# Data Scientist Interview

Weâ€™re looking to see how you would approach a Customer Clustering problem and have provided a sample dataset for you to
explore and potentially produce a working prototype.

You will need to present your thoughts and approach on this back to us where we are looking at what you produced in the
prototype, understanding of the dataset, and your thoughts to a long term approach and options moving forward.

Your model should be developed in a Jupyter notebook and emailed to us before the interview. You will be asked to walk us through your notebook.

This is intended as a few hours within an evening and we do not expect you to spend significant time on this.

**Please do not publish the dataset privately or publicly**

### Considerations:
- What Logic based approaches, ML, Deep learning options are there?
- What a long term option may look like and how would an iterative approach to delivering look like

### File Description:
The dataset provided consists of a selection of mock customer data, with mostly numerical aggregation fields. These
include:
- Dates (in YYYYMMDD format) pertaining to customer activity.
- Columns pertaining to the number of orders and items the customer has ordered, and what they have spent.
- Values of their first and last, and highest and lowest, orders.
- Whether customers purchase only full price items, only items on sale, or both; and how much.
- How much they have purchased in each of our divisions: womenswear, menswear, or homeware.
- How much they have spent in store (retail) vs online (web).
- Subsets of this data for the last twelve, six, and three months.
- The customer's preferred language.
